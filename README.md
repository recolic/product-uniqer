# magic program

> I don't know what's this shitty program doing. I was forced to write it.

`./main.py` is named as PROGRAM ALPHA, and `summerize-part-list/main.py` is named as PROGRAM BETA. (Because the program sucks, and too difficult to name them)

Firstly, run PROGRAM BETA to generate one dir (with some pdf-s), one sheet (as the input of ALPHA), and another csv (containing errors).

Then run ALPHA to get the final result.
